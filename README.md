# CURRENCY CONVERTER 

This is a currency converter project. we have used react as a frontend language and currency api as backend to get the currency values.

Topics covered while building this project 
    -- UseId Hook 
    -- UseState Hook
    -- importing all the components in one index.jsx file and then exporting those imported components (By doing this you can just simply import the index.jsx file to App.jsx rather than all the components )
    -- Designed Custom Hook (UseCurrencyInfo Hook)
    -- Extracted Keys from the object (Object.keys(object_name))
